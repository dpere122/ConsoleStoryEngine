# ConsoleStoryEngine

## Purpose:
I wanted a simple way to narrate a story just using a console. The intro to Elden ring is the first story to be narrated through the narrate engine.

## Building:
```
git clone <Repo>

cd ConsoleStoryEngine/src/

mkdir build/

cd build/

//get dependencies
cmake ../

//build and run
make

./NarrateEngine
```

## TODO:
- Add song support - play song on startup
- Read from files using simple JSON format
- Add drawing image effect for img formats
